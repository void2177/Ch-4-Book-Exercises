## For these exercises, I generally struggled because I'm not that good algebraically, and thus couldn't integrate math with Turtle functions. However,  for the first 3 exercises, I managed to complete them successfully. I could visualize how to do the third exercise, and that allowed me to figure out/backtrack how to do the second exercise. The fourth exercise I genuinely tried my best but I couldn't get rid of the space in between triangles. The fifth exercise, I didn't understand how to create the arc/petal, and consequently, the fourth and fifth exercises  were done better by the instructor. The first three exercises didn't have much margin for meaningful difference between my solution and the instructor's. The difference between exercises 4 and 5 were the limit of how I could improve my solutions.
